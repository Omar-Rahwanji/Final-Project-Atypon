# Final_Project
-The system has 2 tables, with a one to one relationship. The tables are Customer and Account (each customer has a single account).
-Tables constrained are guranteed when doing any CRUD operation.
-The system is connected to a simple CI/CD server (jenkins).
-Both tomcat and jenkins are installed locally on my windows machine.
